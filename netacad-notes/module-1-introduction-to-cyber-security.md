Module 1 – Introduction to Cybersecurity

What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks.  
These attacks often aim to:
Steal sensitive information
Disrupt services
Damage or alter data
Gain unauthorized access

Why Cybersecurity Matters

For individuals: Protects personal data like banking details, identity documents, and private communication.
For businesses: Prevents data breaches, financial losses, and brand damage.
For governments: Secures national infrastructure like power grids, healthcare systems, and defense.

Core Goals The CIA Triad

Availability  
  Systems and services must be available when needed, without disruptions.

What I Learned

Cybersecurity is more than a tech concept, it’s a critical part of everyday digital life.  
As we rely more on tech, the need to protect our data, systems, and identities becomes even more important.

Every user plays a role in cybersecurity.
