Module 2 – Attacks, Concepts and Techniques

What Are Cyber Attacks?

Cyber attacks are malicious attempts to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data.



Common Types of Attacks

Malware – Software designed to cause harm  
  (e.g., viruses, worms, ransomware, trojans)

Phishing – Deceptive emails or messages that trick users into giving up sensitive data

Denial-of-Service (DoS) – Overloading a system to make it unavailable

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) – Intercepting communication between two parties

SQL Injection – Injecting malicious code into databases via input fields


Types of Threat Actors

Script Kiddies – Inexperienced hackers using pre-made tools
Hacktivists – Attackers driven by political or social causes
Organized Crime – Groups focused on financial gain
Nation-State Actors – Government-funded cyber units
Insiders – Employees or contractors who misuse access



Attack Vectors (How Attacks Are Delivered)

Phishing emails
USB devices with malware
Unpatched software vulnerabilities
Malicious websites or downloads
Wi-Fi spoofing or unsecured networks


Defense Concepts Introduced

Defense in Depth – Multiple layers of security (firewalls, antivirus, MFA, etc.)
Principle of Least Privilege – Users should only have access to what they need
Patch Management – Keeping software and systems updated
Threat Intelligence – Using data and analysis to predict and prevent attacks


What I Learned

Cyber attacks come in many forms and from many sources.  
Understanding attacker motives and methods helps in building better defenses.  
Staying up to date and practicing layered protection is key to staying secure.
