This final module focused on career paths in cybersecurity, the roles available (like SOC analyst, penetration tester, incident responder), and the skills and certifications needed to enter the field. 
It highlighted the importance of continuous learning and ethical responsibility. I also learned how cybersecurity professionals protect not just systems but the people and data behind them, making the field both technically exciting and socially impactful.
