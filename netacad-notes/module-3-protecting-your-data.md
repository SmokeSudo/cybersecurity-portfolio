Module 3: Protecting Your Data and Privacy

Personal Data & PII

PII (Personally Identifiable Information) includes name, address, ID number, biometrics, financial records, etc.
Hackers target PII for identity theft, fraud, and resale on the dark web.

Threats to Privacy

Tracking cookies, social media behavior, and location data can be harvested without your full consent.
Social engineering attacks often start with info you unknowingly share.

Tools for Protecting Privacy

VPNs: Encrypt your internet traffic and hide your IP.
Encryption: Protects files, messages, and drives from unauthorized access.
2FA/MFA: Adds extra layers of authentication to reduce unauthorized logins.
Password Managers: Create strong, unique passwords without having to remember them.

Unsafe Practices to Avoid

Using public Wi-Fi without VPN
Reusing passwords across platforms
Clicking unknown email links (phishing)
Oversharing on social media

Best Practices

Always enable 2FA/MFA where possible.
Don’t overshare personal info online.
Use encrypted messaging apps when needed.
Regularly update and patch software.
